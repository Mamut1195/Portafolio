        Hi, I am Jonnathan Torres. Civil Enginner who has learned the fundamentals of software enginnering.
        Why I decided learning coding ?
        Well, I find it a excited industry. I mean you can contribute to the AEC industry making it a more
        competitive and productive. Coding help us to make pluggins, scripts and more that helps the industry to expand.

        <div className='text-orange-500 font-bold sm:text-xl mb-4'>
        How did I learned coding ?
        </div>
        <div className='text-justify sm:text-lg'>
        It started because I like the idea of automatitation. So I learned python. As I am curious I watched 
        a lo of videos in youtube. I use to heard about Javascript, Nodejs, React, C sharp, Next js. I did not understand 
        what was that, It was new teminology for me. So I started researching about it. I took courses about C sharp, HTML, CSS,
        Javascript, React, C sharp, C ++, Web Development. The courses gave a better understanding about programming. New concepts
        came to me, object Oriented programming, functional programming, declarative programming, imperative programming.<br/>

        <br/>Now I am looking for an opportunity for solving real world problems. I consider my self as a problem solver. Also
        I have the hablity for selflearning.
